''' Running Commands
Often times, we can rely on installed tools and services to provide the
status of an application.

This sample plugin will lay out how to use and what to expect from the
run_cmd() function from Toolkit.

Please refer to the basic python sample for information on plugin
requirements.
'''
import sys
from Toolkit import Log
from Toolkit.run_cmd import run_cmd

'''
Commands can fail in many ways for countless reasons ... dealing with
those failures shouldn't be a chore.  Enter run_cmd().

run_cmd(), in a perfect world, will pass the provided command through
subprocess.Popen() and return the command's output, errors, and exit
status.

  output, errors, status = run_cmd(['ls'])

Where output and errors are stdout and stderr values, and the exit
status is from Popen().wait().  The command can be provided as either
a string or list.

Optionally, a timeout can be provided to set a max time for the command
to complete (defaults to 20 seconds).  If a timeout occurs, None is
returned as the status.
'''
def main():
	cmd = ['ls', '-la']
	timeout = 20
	output, errors, status = run_cmd(cmd, timeout)
	if status != 0:
		Log.write('Command failed: %s\nOutput: %s\n\nErrors:\n%s' % (
			str(status),
			output,
			errors
		))
		return 1

	if output: print(output)
	if errors: print(errors)
	return status

if __name__ == '__main__':
	sys.exit( main() )
